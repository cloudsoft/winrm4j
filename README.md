# winrm4j

`winrm4j` is a project which enables Java applications to execute batch or PowerShell commands on a remote Windows server 
using [WinRM](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384426(v=vs.85).aspx)

You can download the latest binaries [here](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cloudsoft.windows/winrm4j), which also gives the details
for adding winrm4j as a dependency to your project.

If you wish to build the binaries yourself, you can clone this project, and build it using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/):

`mvn clean install`


### Maven dependency

Add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.cloudsoft.windows</groupId>
  <artifactId>winrm4j</artifactId>
  <version>0.6.1</version> <!-- WINRM4J_VERSION -->
</dependency>
```

### Java client usage

To use winrm4j in Java code, you first create a `WinRmTool` object via the static `WinRmTool.Builder` class.
`WinRmTool.Builder` has several options which you might consider setting before instantiating a `WinRmTool`:

* `workingDirectory(String)`
* `environment(Map<String,String>)`
* `authenticationScheme(String)`
* `disableCertificateChecks(boolean)`
* `useHttps(boolean)`
* `port(int)`

A `WinRmTool` instance supports the basic `executeCommand(String)` method which executes windows native commands.
Through `executeCommand(String)` method supports:

* `executeCommand(List<String>)` execute a list of commands concatenated with &
* `executePs(String)` execute a PowerShell command with the native windows command
* `executePs(List<String>)` execute a list of PowerShell commands

``` java
WinRmClientContext context = WinRmClientContext.newInstance();

WinRmTool tool = WinRmTool.Builder.builder("my.windows.server.com", "Administrator", "pa55w0rd!")
    .authenticationScheme(AuthSchemes.NTLM)
    .port(5985)
    .useHttps(false)
    .context(context)
    .build();

tool.executePs("echo hi");

context.shutdown();
```
